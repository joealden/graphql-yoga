  Hey :wave:,
  It seems like this issue has been inactive for some time. In need for maintaining clear overview of the issues
  concerning the latest version of `graphql-yoga` we'll close it.

  Feel free to reopen it at any time if you believe we should futher discuss its content. :slightly_smiling_face:
